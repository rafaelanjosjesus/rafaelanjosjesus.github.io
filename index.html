            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Rafael, I'm 20 years old and 15 days ago I started a programming course at Trybe! Before Trybe I had never developed anything, in these last 15 days I learned a lot of things like HTML and CSS, I'm also starting to learn about JavaScript but I'm still in the beginning! I hope that in a few months I can come and talk more about the experiences I've had and the projects I've done, but for how long I'll leave that open!</p>
            <h2>This is my second class in HTML!</h2>
